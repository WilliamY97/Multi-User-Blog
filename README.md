Multi User Blog Project

The live version of the project is set up at:

I have used Google App Engine to set up this project. If you want to run the code, please first get Google App Engine SDK for Python:

If you do not have symlinks installed for GAE commands, the launcher will prompt you to install them - please do.

After installing the application, you can run it through the launcher by following:

File -> Add Existing Application -> Add project -> Click Browse
